    <p></p>By using the Sealfie website, mobile applications and making use of a Sealfie Account (the &ldquo;Account&rdquo;) and
    all its related features, you understand that your data in relation with
    your use of our Services is processed according to the following privacy policy.
    This policy states (i) what data we collect through your access and uses of the
    Services; (ii) the use we make of such data; and (iii) the safeguards put in place
    to protect your data. This privacy policy is to be read and understood as being a
    complement to our  terms of service
    .
    <p></p>

  <section id="pricing">
    <h2 id="1-legal-framework">Legal framework</h2>
    <p></p>The Services are operated by Inkan.link SAS (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;, &ldquo;We&rdquo;), domiciled at 41 rue Victor Hugo 38920 Crolles. It is therefore governed
    by the laws and regulations of France.
    <p></p>We are GDPR compliant. The designated representative of the Company in the
    European Union (notably for the purpose of art. 27 GDPR) is Inkan.link SAS, same address.
    <h2 id="2-data-collection-and-usage"></h2><strong>2. Data collection and usage</strong>
    <p></p>Our overriding policy is to never resell our customer data or target for advertising. We intent to share as little
    as possible and with explicit consent with the choosen third parties.
    <page></page>
    <p>Data collection is limited to the following:</p>
    <p></p><strong>2.1 Account creation</strong>
    <p></p>In addition to end-to-end encryption, all content is also cryptographically signed by
    the user, before sending it to us. This means that you can always check the
    signature of any content you get back from our servers, which protects you from
    forgery (e.g. by a malicious actor).
    <p></p><strong>2.6 Communicating with Sealfie</strong>Your communications with us, such as
                                        support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff. The
                                        legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to troubleshoot more
                                        efficiently and improve the quality of our Services.
    <p></p><strong>2.8 Payment information</strong>We rely on third parties to process credit
                                        card, PayPal, and Solana transactions and must therefore share payment information
                                        with them. Anonymous cash or Solana payments and donations are accepted. The legal
                                        basis of this processing is the necessity to the execution of the contract to
                                        provide the Services.
    <p></p><strong>2.9 Native applications</strong>Our native applications, we
                                        (or the mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information. We may use
                                        mobile analytics software (e.g. fabric.io app statistics and crash reporting, Play
                                        Store app statistics, App Store app statistics, or self-hosted Sentry crash
                                        reporting) to send crash information to our developers in order to rapidly fix bugs.
                                        Some platforms, such as Google&rsquo;s Play Store or Apple&rsquo;s App Store may also collect
                                        aggregate, anonymous statistics, which may be governed by their respective privacy
                                        policies and terms and conditions. Such statistics can include most commonly used
                                        devices and operating systems (e.g. percentage of Android 6.x v. Android 7.x), total
                                        number of installs and uninstalls, and the total number of active users.

  <h2 id="5-data-subprocessors">5. Data subprocessors</h2>
  <p></p>To provide the Services, we rely on different data subprocessors, which process
  different categories of data. Processors never store data outside of the scope of
  their specific purpose.<strong></strong>Notably, they do not store data in relation with the
  general day-to-day use of your Account and Services
  , which is   exclusively processed by the Company. Subprocessors are as follow:
  <p></p>
  <h3>5.1 Sealfie Group subprocessors</h3>
  <p></p><strong>Back4app</strong>
  <ul></ul>
  <li>Purpose: Process data account and data information. Files are store in encrypted format only</li>
  <li>Data processing location: Macedonia</li>
  <p></p>
  <h3>5.2 Third-party subprocessors</h3>
  <p></p><strong>Stripe, Inc.</strong>
  <ul></ul>
  <li>
    Purpose: Provide services in relation with the processing of payment data
    (section 2.6)
  </li>
  <li>Data processing location: United States</li>
  <p></p>
  <h2 id="6-data-disclosure">6. Data disclosure</h2>
  <p></p>We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are legally obligated to
  do so by a binding request coming from the competent French authorities. We may
  comply with electronically delivered notices only when they are delivered in full
  compliance with the requirements of French law. Sealfie&rsquo;s general policy is to
  challenge requests whenever possible and where there are doubts as to the validity
  of the request or if there is a public interest in doing so. In such situations, we
  will not comply with the request until all legal or other remedies have been
  exhausted. Under French law, subjects of judicial procedures have to be notified of
  such procedures, although such notification has to come from the authorities and not
  from the Company. Under no circumstances can Sealfie decrypt encrypted message
  content and disclose decrypted copies.

  <h2 id="8-modifications-to-privacy-policy">Modifications to privacy policy</h2>
  <p></p>We reserve the right to periodically review and change this policy from time to time
  and will notify users who have enabled the notification preference about changes to
  our privacy policy. Continued use of the Services will be deemed acceptance of such
  changes.
