# AEO Action Plan - Sealfie

## 📊 Current Status

**Current Score: 96/100 (Grade A)**

Your Sealfie website is already performing exceptionally well in AEO optimization! The main issue is that 7 out of 10 scored pages have first paragraphs that are too short (averaging 17 words instead of the optimal 30-80 words for AI extraction). This is a common and easily fixable issue that's preventing you from reaching a perfect score.

**CRITICAL Direct Answers Breakdown:**
- Your overall Direct Answers score is 58/100 (average across 10 scored pages)
- Only 3 pages are optimized with perfect 30-80 word introductions
- 7 pages need improved first paragraphs for optimal AI search visibility
- 4 legal/privacy pages are excluded from scoring (their 0/100 scores are expected and fine)
- **Impact**: Fixing these 7 pages will significantly boost your overall score and AI search performance
