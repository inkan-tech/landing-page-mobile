# NPM Security Vulnerability Fix Summary

## Results

✅ Successfully reduced vulnerabilities from **54 to 14**

- Eliminated all 5 critical vulnerabilities
- Reduced high severity from 38 to 2
- Remaining: 3 low, 9 moderate, 2 high

## Initial State

54 vulnerabilities (2 low, 9 moderate, 38 high, 5 critical)

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Update browser-sync (Critical - axios vulnerability)

```bash
npm uninstall grunt-browser-sync browser-sync
npm install --save-dev browser-sync@latest grunt-browser-sync@latest
```

### 2. Update pug (Moderate - RCE vulnerability)

Current: pug@3.0.3
Fix: Already on latest version, but grunt-pug-i18n uses old version

### 3. Update imagemin packages (Multiple high severity)

```bash
npm uninstall grunt-contrib-imagemin imagemin-cli imagemin-mozjpeg imagemin-webp
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-imagemin@latest imagemin-cli@latest imagemin-mozjpeg@latest imagemin-webp@latest
```

### 4. Remove pkg.json (Critical - parse-url vulnerability)

This package has critical vulnerabilities and seems unused

```bash
npm uninstall pkg.json
```

## Manual Updates Required

Edit package.json to update:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "browser-sync": "^3.0.4",  // Update to latest
    "grunt-browser-sync": "^3.0.0",  // Update to latest
    "grunt-contrib-imagemin": "^5.0.0",  // Update to latest
    "imagemin": "^9.0.1",  // Keep current
    "imagemin-cli": "^8.0.0",  // Keep current
    "imagemin-mozjpeg": "^10.0.0",  // Keep current
    "imagemin-webp": "^8.0.0"  // Keep current
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // Remove "pkg.json": "^2.0.9"
  }
}
```

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Removed `pkg.json` package (critical parse-url vulnerability)
2. ✅ Added npm overrides for critical packages:
   - axios: ^1.7.7
   - braces: ^3.0.3
   - cross-spawn: ^7.0.6
   - nth-check: ^2.1.1
   - got: ^14.4.5
   - http-cache-semantics: ^4.1.1
   - semver-regex: ^4.0.5
3. ✅ Updated browser-sync to ^3.0.4
4. ✅ Build tested and working

## Remaining Vulnerabilities (14 total)

### Cannot Fix (dependency constraints)

1. **pug/pug-code-gen** in grunt-pug-i18n - No fix available
2. **micromatch** in grunt-contrib-imagemin - Would break image optimization
3. **send/serve-static** in grunt-browser-sync - Browser sync dependency
4. **trim-newlines** in meow - CLI dependency

These remaining vulnerabilities are all in development dependencies and don't affect production code.

## Recommendation

The critical and high-severity production vulnerabilities have been fixed. The remaining issues are in dev dependencies that would require major refactoring or replacing core build tools. Consider:

1. Monitor for updates to grunt-pug-i18n
2. Consider migrating from Grunt to a modern build tool (Vite, Webpack)
3. Regular security audits with `npm audit`
