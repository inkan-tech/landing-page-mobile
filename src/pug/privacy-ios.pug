    | In addition to end-to-end encryption, all content is also cryptographically signed by
    | the user, before sending it to us. This means that you can always check the

    strong 2.6 Communicating with Sealfie
    | Your communications with us, such as
    |                                     support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff. The
    |                                     legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to troubleshoot more

    p
    | We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are legally obligated to
    | do so by a binding request coming from the competent French authorities. We may
    | comply with electronically delivered notices only when they are delivered in full
    | compliance with the requirements of French law. Sealfie&rsquo;s general policy is to
    | challenge requests whenever possible and where there are doubts as to the validity
    | of the request or if there is a public interest in doing so. In such situations, we
    | will not comply with the request until all legal or other remedies have been
    | exhausted. Under French law, subjects of judicial procedures have to be notified of
    | such procedures, although such notification has to come from the authorities and not
    | from the Company. Under no circumstances can Sealfie decrypt encrypted message
    | content and disclose decrypted copies.
